			Amelia Bedelia 
			<br>

			<br>
			<br>
			"Here she is! Here’s Amelia Bedelia!" called the Grizzlies. 
			“Then let's play ball,"" said the Tornados. 
			<br>
			<br>
			“The Tornados are up first,"" said Tom. “Amelia Bedelia, 
			you stand here. Catch the ball if it comes your way.” 
			<br>
			<br>
			“All right,” she said. 
			<br>
			<br>
			“Batter up!” called the pitcher. The pitcher threw the 
			ball. The batter hit it. He ran to first base. 
			<br>
			<br>
			“Get the ball, Amelia Bedelia.' yelled Tom. "Tag Jack 
			before he gets to second base.” 
			<br>
			<br>
			"I must have a tag in here somewhere,” said Amelia 
			Bedelia. She tagged Jack. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Another boy came up to bat. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Dick hit the ball. The ball landed 
			near Amelia Bedelia. 
			<br>
			<br>
			“Throw it to first base," 
			yelled the boys. 
			<br>
			<br>
			“Put Dick out” So 
			Amelia Bedelia threw the 
			ball to first base. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Then she ran and 
			grabbed Dick. “How 
			far out do you want 
			him?" she called. 
			<br>
			<br>
			“Amelia Bedelia!” shouted the 
			boys. "Put him down." 
			<br>
			<br>
			So Amelia Bedelia put Dick 
			down. “You sure do change 
			your minds fast,” she said. 
			<br>
			<br>
			“You told me to put him out!"
			<br>
			<br>
			Dick got back on first base. And the game went on. The 
			next batter missed the ball. The catcher threw the ball to 
			the pitcher. The pitcher missed it. But Amelia Bedelia 
			caught it! 
			<br>
			<br>
			"Hurry, Amelia Bedelia! Throw the ball!" shouted the 
			boys. "Dick is trying to steal second base. 
			<br>
			<br>
			"Steal second base!” said Amelia Bedelia. “That’s not 
			nice." 
			<br>
			<br>
			Amelia Bedelia ran and picked up 
			second base. “It’s all 
			right now, fellows." She called. “Second 
			base is safe." 
			<br>
			<br>
			“For gosh sakes,
			Amelia Bedelia!" said 
			the boys. “Put that 
			back ” 
			<br>
			<br>
			Amelia Bedelia 
			looked puzzled. "But he was going to 
			steal it," she said. 
			<br>
			<br>
			"It's all right to 
			steal bases." said 
			Tom. “That is part 
			of the game” 
			<br>
			<br>
			"Oh!" said Amelia 
			Bedelia. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Finally the Tornados were out. They had made two runs. 
			It was the Grizzlies’ turn at bat. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Tom was first. He struck out. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Then Jimmy had his turn. He hit that ball hard. He 
			made it to third base. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Next it was Bob's turn, he hit the ball. 
			<br>
			"Pop fly" called the pitcher. “I’ve got it.” 
			<br>
			"Pop fly?” said Amelia Bedelia. “I didn't hear anything."
			<br>
			<br>
			Then it was Amelia Bedelia's turn. 
			<br>
			<br>
			"Come on, Amelia Bedelia,” said Bob. "Make a base hit 
			so Jimmy can come in." 
			<br>
			<br>
			“Which base should I hit?” she asked. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Tom said, “Just hit that ball and run to first base!" 
			<br>
			<br>
			"All right." said Amelia Bedelia. And that is just what she did, 
			<br>
			<br>
			Jimmy scored for the Grizzlies. The team cheered. The 
			next player struck out. The Tornados were at bat again. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The score was Tornados 2, Grizzlies 1, The Grizzlies 
			called a time-out. 
			<br>
			<br>
			"Amelia Bedelia is not very good in the field, said 
			Jimmy. 
			<br>
			<br>
			"She gets all mixed up,” said Tom, 
			<br>
			<br>
			"Maybe she could be catcher," said Bob. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The boys turned to Amelia Bedelia. 
			<br>
			<br>
			"Stand behind the batter 
			and catch the ball," said 
			<br>
			<br>
			Jimmy. “Then throw it back 
			to the pitcher.” 
			<br>
			<br>
			So Amelia Bedelia stood 
			behind the batter. The 
			<br>
			<br>
			pitcher threw the ball. The 
			batter was about to hit it. 
			But Amelia Bedelia pushed him out of the way. 
			<br>
			<br>
			And Amelia Bedelia caught the ball. "I got it, fellows!" she called. The whole team groaned. The Tornados were 
			very angry, 
			<br>
			<br>
			"Put her someplace else," they shouted. “Put her way 
			out. 
			<br>
			<br>
			So the Grizzlies put Amelia Bedelia way out in the field. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The game was not going well for the Grizzlies. The score 
			was Tornados 8, Grizzlies 5, 
			<br>
			<br>
			The Grizzlies were at bat. It was the last inning. They 
			had two outs. The bases were loaded. And Amelia Bedelia 
			was at bat. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The Grizzlies were worried. "Please, Amelia Bedelia." 
			they said, “Please hit that ball hard.” 
			<br>
			<br>
			Amelia Bedelia swung at the first ball. She missed. 
			<br>
			<br>
			 She swung at the second ball. And again she missed. 
			<br>
			<br>
			“Please, Amelia Bedelia, please.” shouted the Grizzlies. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Amelia Bedelia swung at the next ball. And oh, how she 
			hit that ball! 
			<br>
			<br>
			“Run, Amelia Bedelia, run!” yelled the boys. "Run to first 
			base” And Amelia Bedelia ran. 
			<br>
			<br>
			“Tom says stealing is all right," she said, "so I'll just steal 
			all the bases. I will make sure the Grizzlies win.” 
			<br>
			<br>
			Amelia Bedelia scooped up first base, and second base, 
			and third base, 
			<br>
			<br>
			"Home!" shouted the boys. "Run home, Amelia Bedelia!" 
			Amelia Bedelia looked puzzled, but she did not stop 
			<br>
			<br>
			running. And on her way she 
			scooped up home plate too. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The boys were too surprised 
			to say a thing. Then Tom 
			yelled, "We won! We won the 
			game!” 
			<br>
			<br>
			“Amelia Bedelia, come back!” 
			shouted the boys. "We won!” 
			But Amelia Bedelia was 
			running too fast to hear. She 
			did not stop until she 
			reached home. 
			<br>
			<br>
			"That is a silly game,” she 
			said. "Having me run all the 
			way home!” 
			<br>
			<br>
			Suddenly she heard a loud roar. “Hurray! Hurray! Hurray 
			for Amelia Bedelia!" There were the Grizzlies. 
			<br>
			<br>
			"We won! The score was Grizzlies 9, Tornados 8,” said 
			Jimmy. “You saved the game, Amelia Bedelia” 
			<br>
			<br>
			I'm glad I could help you boys out,” said Amelia Bedelia.
